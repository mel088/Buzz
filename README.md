## My Microblogging Messaging Platform

You can check out my source code for my twitter-like messaging platform in the folder [Lab11](https://github.com/mel088/Buzz/tree/master/lab11/templates).

For my final project in CSCI040 Computing for the Web, I was tasked with creating a messaging platform with create user, create message, login, and log out capabilities.
For extra credit, I also wrote code to allow users to delete their messages and their account and I created a nicely themed webpage using [CSS](https://github.com/mel088/Buzz/blob/master/lab11/static/style.css).
